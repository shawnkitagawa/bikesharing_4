# Summary 
In conclusion, there are a lot of male who like to use bike as a transportaion to go to work and also after work, range of 10 to 20 min apart from working place. We can expect a low risk with small volatiliy on the profit for this business model because this bike-sharing program is targetting mainly workers who are looking to use bike as an transportation. Since, alot of worker are relying bike as a transportaion, there's low possibility that the demand of bike renting will decrease.
